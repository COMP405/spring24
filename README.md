This is the COMP840 class public repo. The start code will be posted here each week. 
You will need to set up your own local repo and also a remote reference to this repo for pulling the code. 

```
$ git remote add instructor https://github.com/machine-learning-applications-and-tools/Spring2024.git
$ git pull instructor main
```
